Portfolio Design Process:

During the creation of my web portfolio, I went through design process that involved several key steps. Firstl, in the User Experience Design I course, I conducted an in-depth analysis of my personal brand, the kind of projects I wanted to showcase, and who I wanted to target my work towards. This helped me establish a cohesive design direction and choose a colour scheme that resonated with my personaility style.

Next, I created rough wireframes and prototypes to see how my portfolio would be structured. By utilizing Bootstrap, I made sure the design adapted smoothly to different devices, guaranteeing a user-friendly experience.

Challenges:

Throughout the development phase, I encountered a few challenges that tested my problem-solving skills and patience. One notable challenge that came across several times was achieving perfect alignment and consistent spacing in various areas of my portfolio. I tackled this challenge by taking advantage of Bootstrap's grid system and custom CSS adjustments to personalize the layout and achieve my desired look.

Another challenge I faced that tested my patience more so was deriving many image sizes to optimize them for web performance without compromising image quality. I implemented image compression to every image that I believed needed it to ensure fast loading times without sacrificing visual appeal.

Key Learnings:

I've learned how to make user-friendly designs that work well on various devices, thanks to responsive design principles and Bootstrap. I've also improved my problem-solving abilities by overcoming technical challenges during development. Overall, creating my web portfolio has improved my HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap skills, and taught me the value of detail and ongoing learning in web development.
